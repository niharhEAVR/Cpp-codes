### ü•á **1. Precedence** (Which operator comes first?)

* **Precedence** determines the **order in which operators are evaluated** in an expression.
* Higher precedence = evaluated **before** lower precedence operators.

#### Example:

```cpp
int x = 2 + 3 * 4;
```

* `*` has **higher precedence** than `+`.
* So, `3 * 4` is done first ‚Üí `2 + 12` ‚Üí result is `14`.

---

### üîÑ **2. Associativity** (If same precedence, which direction?)

* If two operators **have the same precedence**, **associativity** tells whether they are evaluated:

  * **Left to right** (left-associative)
  * **Right to left** (right-associative)

#### Example:

```cpp
int x = 10 - 5 - 2;
```

* `-` has **left-to-right** associativity.
* So: `(10 - 5) - 2` ‚Üí `5 - 2` ‚Üí result is `3`.

Another example:

```cpp
int y = 2 = 3;  // ‚ùå Invalid
int a = b = c = 5;
```

* `=` is **right-to-left** associative.
* So: `a = (b = (c = 5));`

### üëÄ Tip for Beginners:

Always use **parentheses** `()` to make expressions clear and avoid confusion with precedence or associativity.

#### Example:

```cpp
int result = (a + b) * c;
```

### ‚ùå The Problem Line:

```cpp
std::cout << "number1 < number2 : " << number1 < number2 << std::endl;
```

#### ‚ùì Why is this wrong?

Because of **operator precedence**:

* `<<` (stream insertion) has **higher precedence** than `<` (comparison).
* So this line is interpreted like this:

  ```cpp
  (std::cout << "number1 < number2 : " << number1) < number2 << std::endl;
  ```

Now, let‚Äôs break it:

1. `std::cout << "..." << number1` is okay ‚Äî it prints.
2. The result of that expression is still an `ostream` (like `std::cout`).
3. Then you're trying to do:

   ```cpp
   ostream < number2
   ```

   ‚ùó This is invalid: comparing an `ostream` object with an `int` using `<` makes **no sense**, so the compiler throws an error.

---

### ‚úÖ The Correct Line:

```cpp
std::cout << "number1 < number2 : " << (number1 < number2) << std::endl;
```

#### ‚úî Why does this work?

* The parentheses force `number1 < number2` to be evaluated **first**.
* So you're effectively doing:

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "..." << (true or false) << std::endl;
  ```
* C++ will print:

  * `1` for `true`
  * `0` for `false`
