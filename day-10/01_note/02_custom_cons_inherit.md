### 🔹 The Situation

You have a class hierarchy like this (simplified):

```cpp
class Person {
protected:
    std::string m_full_name;
    int m_age;
private:
    std::string m_address; // private
public:
    Person(std::string_view fullname, int age, std::string_view address)
        : m_full_name(fullname), m_age(age), m_address(address) {}
};
```

```cpp
class Engineer : public Person {
protected:
    int m_contract_count;
public:
    Engineer(std::string_view fullname, int age, std::string_view address, int contract_count)
        : Person(fullname, age, address), m_contract_count(contract_count) {}
};
```

```cpp
class CivilEngineer : public Engineer {
    std::string m_speciality;
public:
    CivilEngineer(std::string_view fullname, int age,
                  std::string_view address, int contract_count, std::string_view speciality);
};
```

---

### 🔹 Why the *BAD* Versions Fail

1. ❌ **Direct assignment of base members**

```cpp
CivilEngineer::CivilEngineer(std::string_view fullname,int age,
    std::string_view address,int contract_count,std::string_view speciality)
{
    m_full_name = fullname;
    m_age = age;
    // m_address = address; // ERROR: private in Person
    m_speciality = speciality;
}
```

* Here you’re trying to **reassign members** in the constructor body.
* `m_address` is **private to `Person`**, so neither `Engineer` nor `CivilEngineer` can touch it.

---

2. ❌ **Initializer list with base’s private member**

```cpp
CivilEngineer::CivilEngineer(std::string_view fullname,int age,
    std::string_view address,int contract_count,std::string_view speciality)
    : m_full_name(fullname), m_age(age), m_address(address), m_speciality(speciality)
{ }
```

* Even worse: you’re trying to initialize **`m_address` directly**.
* That’s **illegal**, because `m_address` belongs to `Person` and is `private`.

⚠️ Remember: **Derived classes cannot directly initialize base’s members**. Only the **base’s constructor** can.

---

### 🔹 The Correct Way ✅

```cpp
CivilEngineer::CivilEngineer(std::string_view fullname, int age,
                             std::string_view address, int contract_count, std::string_view speciality)
    : Engineer(fullname, age, address, contract_count), // calls Engineer ctor → which calls Person ctor
      m_speciality(speciality)
{
    std::cout << "Custom constructor called for CivilEngineer...\n";
}
```

✔ Why this works:

* `CivilEngineer` calls the **`Engineer` constructor** in its initializer list.
* That `Engineer` constructor, in turn, calls the **`Person` constructor**.
* Only the `Person` constructor can set `m_address` (because it’s private).

So the constructor chain looks like:

```
CivilEngineer → Engineer → Person
```

and **each class is responsible for its own members**.

---

### 🔹 Golden Rule

👉 In inheritance:

* **Never directly touch base’s private members**.
* Always **delegate initialization up the chain** using base constructors.
