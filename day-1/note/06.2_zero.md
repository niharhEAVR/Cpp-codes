Fantastic question! You're touching on one of the **most interesting parts** of floating-point arithmetic in C++ (and most modern languages) — how division by zero with `double` **does not cause a runtime crash**, but instead gives `inf` or `nan`.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## 🧠 First: Why no runtime error?

In **C++**, dividing an `integer` by zero **does** cause a **runtime error** (like `SIGFPE`, or "Floating Point Exception").

But for **`float` and `double`**, it **does NOT**. Why?

### ✅ Because:

C++ uses the **IEEE 754** floating-point standard — the same used by most modern CPUs and languages — which **defines behavior** for such situations.

---

## ✅ IEEE 754 Defines Special Results for These:

| Expression  | Meaning         | Result    |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- |
| `n1 / 0.0`  | non-zero ÷ zero | `inf` (∞) |
| `0.0 / 0.0` | zero ÷ zero     | `nan`     |
| `0.0 / n1`  | zero ÷ non-zero | `0.0`     |

---

## 🧪 Applying it to Your Code:

```cpp
double n1 {5.6};
double n2 {};   // default initializes to 0.0
double n3 {};   // default initializes to 0.0

std::cout << n1/n2 << std::endl;  // 5.6 / 0.0 → +∞
std::cout << n2/n3 << std::endl;  // 0.0 / 0.0 → NaN
std::cout << n2/n1 << std::endl;  // 0.0 / 5.6 → 0.0
```

### 🔍 Output:

```
inf
nan
0
```

---

## 🔬 Why It’s Not a Crash (Unlike Integers):

### Integers:

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 0;
std::cout << a / b;  // ❌ Runtime crash (division by zero)
```

The CPU throws an exception because there's **no representation for `∞` or `NaN` in integers**.

---

### Floating-point:

```cpp
double a = 5.6;
double b = 0.0;
std::cout << a / b;  // ✅ Prints "inf"
```

The CPU **doesn't crash** because:

* It just sets a **special bit pattern** in the result to mean `inf` or `nan`.

---

## ✅ How to Check for These in Code:

You can detect them with standard library functions:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

if (std::isinf(n1 / n2)) {
    std::cout << "Infinity detected!" << std::endl;
}
if (std::isnan(n2 / n3)) {
    std::cout << "NaN detected!" << std::endl;
}
```

---

## 🧠 Summary:

| Condition      | Result  | Reason                               |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `double / 0.0` | `inf`   | Defined by IEEE 754                  |
| `0.0 / 0.0`    | `nan`   | Indeterminate; result is undefined   |
| `0.0 / double` | `0.0`   | Valid zero result                    |
| `int / 0`      | ❌ crash | No IEEE fallback; triggers exception |

So: `float`/`double` division by 0.0 is **safe**, **predictable**, and **standardized**.
