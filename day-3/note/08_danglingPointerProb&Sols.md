## ✅ First: What is a Dangling Pointer?

A **dangling pointer** is a pointer that:

* Points to **invalid memory**, either because:

  * The memory was **never assigned** (uninitialized pointer)
  * The memory has been **deleted/freed**
  * The object it pointed to is **out of scope**

Using a dangling pointer leads to **undefined behavior**: crashes, garbage values, or even data corruption.

---

## 🔴 CASE 1: Uninitialized Pointer

```cpp
int* p_number; // Dangling uninitialized pointer
std::cout << "p_number : " << p_number << std::endl;
std::cout << "*p_number : " << *p_number << std::endl; // CRASH!
```

### 🧠 What's happening:

* `p_number` is declared but **not initialized**.
* It holds a **random garbage address**.
* Dereferencing (`*p_number`) means accessing **random memory** → leads to a **crash or corruption**.

### ✅ Solution:

```cpp
int* p_number5{nullptr}; // Safe default initialization
```

**Always initialize pointers**, preferably to `nullptr`, so we can safely check if it’s valid before use.

---

## 🔴 CASE 2: Deleted Pointer

```cpp
int *p_number1 {new int{67}};
delete p_number1;
std::cout << "*p_number1(after delete) : " << *p_number1 << std::endl; // ❌ DANGEROUS
```

### 🧠 What's happening:

* Memory is **dynamically allocated**, then **freed** using `delete`.
* But `p_number1` still **points to the freed memory**.
* Dereferencing it is like accessing **ghost memory** → **undefined behavior**.

### ✅ Solution:

```cpp
delete p_number7;
p_number7 = nullptr; // Safe reset after deletion
```

**Always reset a pointer to `nullptr` after `delete`.**

Then use:

```cpp
if (p_number7 != nullptr)
```

to ensure it’s safe before dereferencing.

---

## 🔴 CASE 3: Multiple Pointers to Same Memory

```cpp
int *p_number3 {new int{83}};   // Allocate memory on the heap
int *p_number4 {p_number3};     // p_number4 points to the same memory as p_number3

delete p_number3;               // Memory is deallocated (freed)

// ❌ p_number4 still points to the now-deleted memory (dangling pointer)
std::cout << "*p_number4 : " << *p_number4 << std::endl;
```

---

## 🔍 What Exactly is Happening?

### 1. Memory Allocation:

```cpp
int* p_number3 = new int{83};
```

* `new int{83}` allocates **heap memory**, let's say at address `0x1000`.
* `p_number3` stores this address (`0x1000`).

### 2. Pointer Copy:

```cpp
int* p_number4 = p_number3;
```

* Now `p_number4` also stores the same address `0x1000`.
* So **both** `p_number3` and `p_number4` point to **the same location in memory**.

📌 This is called **shared ownership**.
But neither pointer knows who is responsible for deleting the memory.

### 3. Deletion:

```cpp
delete p_number3;
```

* Memory at address `0x1000` is **freed/deallocated**.
* But `p_number4` still holds the **old address** (`0x1000`).
* If you now do `*p_number4`, you're **dereferencing freed memory** → CRASH 💥 or **garbage data**.

This is the **dangling pointer problem**!

---

## 🧨 What Can Go Wrong?

* ❌ Crash: You try to access memory that the OS has reclaimed.
* ❌ Garbage: It may appear to work but gives you wrong values.
* ❌ Security Risk: May lead to corrupting other parts of memory.

---

## ✅ Proper Solution

## 🧠 Problem Recap in 1 Line:

You have **two pointers** (`p_number3` and `p_number4`) pointing to the **same memory**.
You `delete` one (`p_number3`), but **still try to use** the other (`p_number4`) → 💥 **dangling pointer**!

---

## ✅ Solution Plan:

> **Idea**: Choose **ONE main pointer** that is **responsible for deleting** the memory.
> Others (copies) should only be used **while the main pointer is valid** (not `nullptr`).

---

## ✅ Code Walkthrough (with Explanation):

```cpp
// Master pointer owns the memory
int* p_number8 = new int{382};
```

* ✅ `new int{382}` creates memory on the heap.
* ✅ `p_number8` stores the address of that memory.
* ✅ We decide that `p_number8` is the **"master" pointer** – it will **own and delete** the memory.

```cpp
// Slave pointer just borrows the address
int* p_number9 = p_number8;
```

* `p_number9` is a **copy**.
* ❗ It doesn't "own" the memory — just uses it **as long as `p_number8` is valid**.

---

### 🟢 Now we use the pointer **safely**:

```cpp
if (p_number8 != nullptr) {
    std::cout << "p_number9 : " << *p_number9 << std::endl;
}
```

* ✅ We only **dereference** (`*p_number9`) **if `p_number8` is still valid**.
* ✅ This avoids accessing deleted memory.

---

### ❌ Time to delete the memory:

```cpp
delete p_number8;
p_number8 = nullptr;
```

* ✅ This **frees** the heap memory.
* ✅ We reset the **master pointer** to `nullptr` to show: **"This memory is gone now."**
* ❗ `p_number9` still holds the **old, deleted address**, but now we know not to use it.

---

### 🛑 Now we **safely refuse to use the slave pointer**:

```cpp
if (p_number8 != nullptr) {
    std::cout << *p_number9 << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cerr << "WARNING : Trying to use an invalid pointer" << std::endl;
}
```

* ✅ Because `p_number8 == nullptr`, the if-condition **fails**, so we **don’t access `p_number9`**.
* ✅ This prevents a **crash** or **undefined behavior**.
* ✅ You know memory is already gone, so the program avoids doing something stupid.

## 🔐 Summary of the Solution Logic:

| Step                                              | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1. Choose a master pointer                        | Only this one deletes memory            |
| 2. Other pointers can access memory               | But only **while master is valid**      |
| 3. After delete, master is set to nullptr         | All others must check master before use |
| 4. Prevent slave pointers from using freed memory | Ensures safety and avoids crash         |

## 🔄 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine:

* `p_number8` is the **house owner** (master)
* `p_number9` is a **tenant** (slave) with keys
* When the owner **sells the house** (delete)
* The tenant’s key still fits, but if he tries to enter, the **house is gone!**

So you:

* Tell the tenant: “Only go in **if the owner still owns it**.”
