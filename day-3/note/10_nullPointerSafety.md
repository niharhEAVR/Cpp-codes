## ✅ What Is Null Pointer Safety?

**Null pointer safety** means **checking whether a pointer is `nullptr`** before:

* dereferencing it (`*p`)
* deleting it (`delete p`)
* using it in general logic

This helps prevent **undefined behavior**, **segmentation faults**, and **crashes**.

## 🧩 Let’s Go Through Your Code

### 🔹 Part 1: Initialization and Verbose Null Check

```cpp
int* p_number{}; // Automatically initialized to nullptr
p_number = new int(7); // Dynamically allocate memory and store 7
```

* ✅ `int* p_number{}` initializes `p_number` to `nullptr`.
* ✅ `new int(7)` allocates memory for an `int`, assigns it the value `7`, and returns the address.

---

### 🔍 Null Checks — Two Ways

#### Way 1: Verbose

```cpp
if (!(p_number == nullptr))
```

* You're checking if `p_number` is **not** equal to `nullptr` (i.e., it's valid).
* ✅ Safe before dereferencing.

#### Way 2: Idiomatic (Clean)

```cpp
if (p_number)
```

* This does **exactly the same thing**.
* ✅ In C++, a pointer in a boolean condition automatically checks for `nullptr`.
* This is the **recommended, cleaner way**.

✅ In both cases, since `p_number` is valid, you'll print:

```bash
p_number points to a VALID address
*p_number : 7
```

### 🔥 Deletion and the `nullptr` Statement

```cpp
delete p_number;
p_number = nullptr;
```

Which would reset the pointer to avoid dangling pointers.

---

### ✅ Safe Deletion of Null Pointers

```cpp
int* p_number1{}; // nullptr
delete p_number1;
```

* ✅ `delete nullptr` is **completely safe** in C++.
* It’s guaranteed by the C++ standard:

> *"If the operand of `delete` is a null pointer, no action is taken."*

So you don’t need to check like this:

```cpp
if (p_number1 != nullptr) {
    delete p_number1;
}
```

Because `delete p_number1;` is already safe, even if it’s `nullptr`.

| `delete p_number1;`                           | Safe, even though it's `nullptr` | ✅                |
| `if (p_number1 != nullptr) delete p_number1;` | Redundant                        | ✅ but not needed |

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Always initialize pointers to `nullptr`**.
2. **Use `if (pointer)` to check validity** before dereferencing.
3. **Calling `delete` on a `nullptr` is safe** — no need to check.
4. **Set pointers to `nullptr` after `delete`** to avoid **dangling pointers**.
