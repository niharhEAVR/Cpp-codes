“**Build your own concepts**” in C++ means **creating custom constraints** for templates using the **C++20 Concepts** feature. It allows you to specify what types a template should accept **more precisely and safely**, improving **code readability, error messages, and type safety**.

---

### 🔹 What Are Concepts in Simple Words?

Concepts are **compile-time predicates** (conditions) that a type must satisfy to be used with a template.

Think of it like:

> “Only allow this template to work with types that support `+` operator.”

---

### 🔹 Why Build Your Own Concepts?

Sometimes, built-in concepts (like `std::integral`, `std::floating_point`, `std::same_as`) aren’t enough. For custom classes, behaviors, or APIs, you need your own rules.

---

## ✅ How to Build Your Own Concept

### 🔸 Step-by-Step

Let’s walk through the process with simple examples.

---

### 🧪 Example 1: Build a Concept to Check if a Type Supports Addition

```cpp
#include <concepts>
#include <type_traits>

// 1. Define your concept
template<typename T>
concept Addable = requires(T a, T b) {
    { a + b } -> std::same_as<T>;  // Must support + and return T
};

// 2. Use the concept in a function template
template<Addable T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

// 3. Test
int main() {
    int x = add(10, 20); // ✅ OK
    // std::string y = add(std::string("Hi"), std::string("Bye")); ❌ Compilation error (not same_as std::string in this constraint)
}
```

---

### 🧪 Example 2: Concept for a Printable Type

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Printable = requires(T x) {
    { std::cout << x };  // Must support stream insertion
};

template<Printable T>
void print(T val) {
    std::cout << val << "\n";
}
```

✔️ Works with `int`, `double`, `std::string`
❌ Won’t compile with a type that doesn't overload `<<`.

---

### 🔸 More Advanced: Combine Concepts

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Number = std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T>;

template<Number T>
T square(T x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

---

## ✅ Benefits of Custom Concepts

| Feature                        | Benefit                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Clearer error messages      | Easier to debug template errors    |
| 🧠 Self-documenting code       | Readable intent                    |
| 🛡️ Stronger type safety       | Avoid invalid operations           |
| ⚡ Faster compile-time feedback | Errors caught before instantiation |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Term                            | Meaning                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept`                       | A rule (predicate) about what a type must support    |
| `requires`                      | A way to test if the type satisfies some expressions |
| `std::same_as`, `std::integral` | Predefined concepts in the `<concepts>` header       |
| Custom concept                  | Your own rules for type compatibility                |

---
---
---


## ✅ Goal of This Example

We want to make a **template function** that **only works** with types that can be added using `+`, **and** that the result of that `+` is the **same type**.

This avoids unwanted errors at compile time and keeps things safe and readable.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation

### ✅ Step 1: Include Headers

```cpp
#include <concepts>     // Needed for concepts like std::same_as
#include <type_traits>  // Also includes useful type checks
```

> These are necessary for using concepts in C++20.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Define Your Own Concept

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Addable = requires(T a, T b) {
    { a + b } -> std::same_as<T>;
};
```

**What's happening here?**

1. **`template<typename T>`**: We're saying this concept works with **any type `T`**.
2. **`requires(T a, T b)`**: We're testing what happens if two variables of type `T` are used inside a `requires` block.
3. **`{ a + b }`**: This is a test to see if we can do `a + b`.
4. **`-> std::same_as<T>`**: And this checks that the result of `a + b` is of the **same type** `T`.

### 🔁 Translation in plain English:

> “This concept applies to types where you can add two values together, and the result is the same type.”

✅ So:

* Works: `int + int = int` → OK
* Works: `double + double = double` → OK
* Fails: `std::string + std::string = std::string` ✅ (but depending on how you wrote `same_as<T>`, it might fail if extra rules are set)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use Concept in a Function Template

```cpp
template<Addable T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This means:

* You can only use `add()` **if** the type `T` satisfies the `Addable` concept.

So it’s a **safe and clean way** to control which types are allowed.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Try Using the Function

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = add(10, 20); // ✅ Works, because int is Addable

    // std::string y = add(std::string("Hi"), std::string("Bye"));
    // ❌ Will not compile if std::same_as<std::string> check fails
}
```

## 🧠 Key Learning

| Part                           | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `concept Addable`              | A rule: "you must be able to add two things and get the same type back" |
| `requires(T a, T b)`           | Try these operations on T at compile-time                               |
| `{ a + b } -> std::same_as<T>` | Check that `a + b` gives a result of type T                             |
| `template<Addable T>`          | Use this function only for types that satisfy Addable                   |

---

## ✅ Summary (Like a Human Explanation)

Imagine you wrote a function `add()` and someone tried to pass two dogs or two cars into it. That makes no sense unless "dogs + dogs" is defined!

Concepts say:

> “Hey compiler, don’t even try to compile this function **unless** the type makes sense with what I want to do — like adding.”

So building your own concept is like **setting a smart rule** at the entrance of your function.



---
---
---










### ✅ First, What Does “Build Your Own Concept” Mean?

Think of **"building your own concept"** like setting your own **rules** for which types are allowed in templates.

For example:

* Want a function to work **only with integers** → make a concept like `MyIntegral`
* Want a function to work **only with types that support `*` or `++`** → make concepts like `Multipliable`, `Incrementable`

These concepts are:

> **Your own rules about types**, so that you can say:
> **"Only allow this function to work if the type supports XYZ."**

---

## ✅ Let's Break Down Your Code in Detail

---

### 🔸 `MyIntegral` Concept

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept MyIntegral = std::is_integral_v<T>;
```

👉 This says:

> Only types like `int`, `long`, `char` are allowed — basically any **integer** type.

You’re building your **own named concept** instead of using `std::integral`.

---

### 🔸 `add()` using `MyIntegral`

```cpp
MyIntegral auto add(MyIntegral auto a, MyIntegral auto b)
```

**What’s happening here?**

* You are using the `MyIntegral` concept on both arguments and the return type.
* So this version of `add()` will **only be chosen** if the arguments are integral types (`int`, `long`, etc.).

**Prints:**

```cpp
MyIntegral auto add uses
```

---

### 🔸 Concept: `Multipliable`

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept Multipliable = requires(T a, T b) {
    a * b;
};
```

> "Only allow types that can be multiplied."

❗ You are defining it, but **not using** it in this code. So it has **no effect right now.**

---

### 🔸 Concept: `Incrementable`

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept Incrementable = requires(T a) {
    a += 1;
    ++a;
    a++;
};
```

> "Only allow types that support:

* `+=`
* Pre-increment `++a`
* Post-increment `a++`"

**If a type can't be incremented, this concept fails.**

---

### 🔸 Another `add()` using `requires Incrementable<T>`

```cpp
template <typename T>
requires Incrementable<T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    std::cout<< "template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses" <<std::endl;
    return a + b;
}
```

So now you have **two versions** of `add()`:

1. `add()` using `MyIntegral`
2. `add()` using `Incrementable<T>`

---

## ✅ What Happens in `main()`?

```cpp
double x{6};
double y{7};

int a{2};
int b{};

double name = add(x, y);  // Which version gets used?
int name2 = add(a, b);    // Which version gets used?
```

Let’s see:

---

### 🔍 `add(x, y)` — both are `double`

* `MyIntegral`? ❌ No — `double` is not an integral type.
* `Incrementable`? ✅ Yes — `double` supports `+=`, `++`, etc.

✔️ So: **The `requires Incrementable<T>` version is used**.

Prints:

```
template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses
```

---

### 🔍 `add(a, b)` — both are `int`

* `MyIntegral`? ✅ Yes — `int` is integral.
* `Incrementable`? ✅ Also yes — `int` supports `++`, `+=`.

Both are valid!

But this is **important**:

> Since `MyIntegral auto` is **more specific** and **not templated**, it is **preferred by the compiler** over the generic one with `requires`.

✔️ So: **The `MyIntegral` version is used.**

Prints:

```
MyIntegral auto add uses
```

---

## ✅ Output Summary:

```
template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses
MyIntegral auto add uses
13
2
```

---

## 🎯 Why Build Concepts?

Without concepts:

* Templates fail with **ugly error messages**
* You can accidentally use types that don’t work at all
* No control over what gets passed

With your own concepts:

* You define exactly **which types are allowed**
* The compiler helps you avoid bugs at compile time
* You write **cleaner and more intention-revealing** code

---

## ✅ Final Verdict: Is This Code Proper?

Yes! ✅ This is **perfectly valid, modern C++20** code, and a good example of:

* **Defining your own concepts**
* **Overloading functions based on those concepts**
* Letting compiler choose the right one

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Imagine you’re writing a function like `cook(Ingredient x)`, and you say:

* Only use this if the ingredient is **vegetable** (your concept).
* If not, maybe use a different rule for **fruit** (another concept).
* You’re building “concepts” of what **kinds** of input you’ll accept.

That’s exactly what’s happening here — just for types like `int`, `double`, or your custom classes.

---
---
---





## ✅ Let's Understand Why This Happened

You expected:

```
template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses
MyIntegral auto add uses
13
2
```

But you got:

```
template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses
template <typename T> requires Incrementable<T> uses
13
2
```

So your program is using the **Incrementable version** of `add()` **both times**, even for `int` — not the `MyIntegral auto` version.

Let’s understand **why**, and how to fix it.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause: Ambiguity Between Overloads

Here's what you wrote:

```cpp
MyIntegral auto add(MyIntegral auto a, MyIntegral auto b) {
    ...
}
```

And also:

```cpp
template <typename T>
requires Incrementable<T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    ...
}
```

Now, consider this:

* `MyIntegral auto` is **deduced as a templated function**, internally.
* But C++20 rules don't always prefer it **over** a regular template with `requires`.

If two templates are equally good, **C++ chooses the first-declared one** or fails to resolve.

> So in your compiler, both versions of `add()` may be considered equally viable, and the `Incrementable<T>` one is getting picked both times.

---

## ✅ Fix: Make `MyIntegral` Version More Specific

We’ll **force it** to be selected when appropriate by **declaring it like a normal template** with `requires` — instead of using `auto` syntax.

### 🔧 Replace This:

```cpp
MyIntegral auto add(MyIntegral auto a, MyIntegral auto b)
```

### ✅ With This:

```cpp
template<typename T>
requires MyIntegral<T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    std::cout << "MyIntegral concept used" << std::endl;
    return a + b;
}
```

Now both overloads are **normal function templates**, and overload resolution works as expected:

* If the type is **integral**, `MyIntegral<T>` version is preferred
* Otherwise, fall back to the `Incrementable<T>` version

---

## ✅ Updated Working Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
concept MyIntegral = std::is_integral_v<T>;

template <typename T>
requires MyIntegral<T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    std::cout << "MyIntegral concept used" << std::endl;
    return a + b;
}

template <typename T>
concept Incrementable = requires(T a) {
    a += 1;
    ++a;
    a++;
};

template <typename T>
requires Incrementable<T>
T add(T a, T b)
{
    std::cout << "Incrementable concept used" << std::endl;
    return a + b;
}

int main()
{
    double x = 6;
    double y = 7;

    int a = 2;
    int b = 0;

    double result1 = add(x, y);  // Incrementable used
    int result2 = add(a, b);     // MyIntegral used

    std::cout << result1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << result2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### ✅ Expected Output:

```
Incrementable concept used
MyIntegral concept used
13
2
```

## 🎯 Summary

| What Happened?                             | Why?                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MyIntegral auto` version was not called   | Because it was not clearly preferred by the compiler during overload          |

> what does concept defining and concept use means, and how does they work, i cant understand that properly, and why the fuck means by defining, i am aos confused


You're asking a **very important** and **honest** question — and it's good you're frustrated, because that means you're **trying to understand deeply**.

Let me explain this **very clearly**, **from scratch**, using simple language.

---

## ✅ What the Hell Are Concepts in C++?

Think of **concepts** as a way to **tell the compiler**:

> “I want this function/template to only work for types that satisfy these rules.”

In short:

| Action                 | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Defining a concept** | You write down what the “rule” is             |
| **Using a concept**    | You apply that rule in a template or function |

---

### 🛠️ Example: A Simple Rule

Let’s say you want to write a function that only works for `int`, `long`, etc. (i.e. **integers**).

---

### ✅ Step 1: Defining a Concept

```cpp
template <typename T>
concept MyIntegral = std::is_integral_v<T>;
```

💬 This means:

> “I define a rule called `MyIntegral`, and it’s true only for integer types like `int`, `long`, `short`.”

---

### ✅ Step 2: Using a Concept

```cpp
template <MyIntegral T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

💬 This means:

> “This function can only be used if T is an integer (i.e. satisfies `MyIntegral`). If not, show a compile-time error.”

---

## ✅ So... What Does “Define” and “Use” Mean?

| Term               | Meaning                                    | Analogy                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Define` a concept | You tell the compiler **what the rule is** | Like writing a rule: "Only people with a ticket can enter"                  |
| `Use` a concept    | You apply that rule **in your code**       | At the door, you **check** if a person has a ticket before allowing them in |

---

## 🔁 Let’s Repeat With Another Example

Suppose you want a function to work only if the type **supports multiplication** (`a * b`).

---

### ✅ Define a concept

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Multipliable = requires(T a, T b) {
    a * b;
};
```

> This says: "`Multipliable<T>` is only true if `a * b` is valid."

---

### ✅ Use that concept

```cpp
template<Multipliable T>
T multiply(T a, T b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

> You are **using the concept** to **limit which types can be passed**.

---

## 🧠 Why Do We Even Need Concepts?

Without concepts:

```cpp
template<typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b; // CRASH if someone passes a weird type like a Dog class
}
```

👎 You’ll get **100-line errors** if `+` is not valid.

With concepts:

```cpp
template<typename T>
requires requires(T a, T b) { a + b; }
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

👍 You get a **clear message**: “You can't call add() with this type.”

---

## ⚠️ Common Misunderstandings (Maybe You Feel This)

| Thought                                            | What It Actually Means                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Why define a concept? I can write code directly.” | You can, but concepts **make your code safer and clearer**                        |
| “I don’t get the ‘requires’ part”                  | It’s just the compiler saying: **“Check if this condition is true for the type”** |
| “Too much boilerplate”                             | Yes, but it helps avoid **runtime crashes and confusing template errors**         |

---

## ✅ Final Summary in One Table

| What You Do          | What Compiler Understands                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| You define a concept | “This is a rule that checks whether a type can do X” |
| You use a concept    | “Only run this code if the type follows the rule”    |

---

## 📌 Think of Concepts Like This:

You’re the **bouncer at a club**:

* You write a rule: “Only 18+ allowed” → (**define concept**)
* You stand at the door and check IDs → (**use concept**)

---
---
---


Excellent question — you're asking:
**"What kind of inputs can or cannot pass through this function using the `Multipliable` concept?"**

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## ✅ Function Definition You're Referring To

```cpp
template<Multipliable T>
T multiply(T a, T b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

This means:

> Only allow calling this `multiply()` function **if** the type `T` supports `a * b`.

---

## 🔍 What Does `Multipliable` Mean?

Let’s define it again to understand:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Multipliable = requires(T a, T b) {
    a * b;
};
```

This concept is satisfied **if and only if**:

* You can write `a * b` for two values of type `T`.
* And it compiles (no errors).

---

## ✅ Inputs That **Pass** This Concept

These types can be multiplied using `*`, so they **pass** the `Multipliable` concept:

| Type                   | Example                | Works? | Why?                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `int`                  | `multiply(2, 3)`       | ✅      | `int * int` is valid              |
| `double`               | `multiply(2.5, 4.0)`   | ✅      | `double * double` is valid        |
| `float`                | `multiply(1.1f, 2.2f)` | ✅      | `float * float` is valid          |
| `long`                 | `multiply(100L, 2L)`   | ✅      | `long * long` is valid            |
| `std::complex<double>` | `multiply(c1, c2)`     | ✅      | Complex numbers can be multiplied |

You can also define your **own types** (like `Matrix`, `Vector`) that overload the `*` operator.

---

## ❌ Inputs That **Fail** This Concept

These types do **not** support multiplication using `*`, so the compiler **rejects** them:

| Type               | Example                   | Fails? | Why?                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `std::string`      | `multiply("hi"s, "bye"s)` | ❌      | Strings don't support `*`            |
| `bool`             | `multiply(true, false)`   | ✅      | (*Yes*, but dangerous. Still works.) |
| `std::vector<int>` | `multiply(v1, v2)`        | ❌      | Vectors don't support `*`            |
| Your custom class  | `multiply(myDog, myDog)`  | ❌      | Unless you overload `*`              |
| `char`             | `multiply('a', 'b')`      | ✅      | *Yes*, promoted to int, valid        |

---

## ✅ Example Code to Try

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <concepts>
#include <complex>
#include <string>

template<typename T>
concept Multipliable = requires(T a, T b) {
    a * b;
};

template<Multipliable T>
T multiply(T a, T b) {
    std::cout << "Multipliable type\n";
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    int a = multiply(3, 4);              // ✅ Works
    double b = multiply(2.5, 4.0);       // ✅ Works
    std::complex<double> c1(1,2), c2(3,4);
    auto c = multiply(c1, c2);           // ✅ Works

    // std::string s1 = "hi", s2 = "bye";
    // auto s = multiply(s1, s2);        // ❌ Error: no operator *

    // std::vector<int> v1, v2;
    // auto v = multiply(v1, v2);        // ❌ Error: no operator *

    return 0;
}
```

Uncomment the `string` or `vector` lines to see the concept rejection happen at **compile time**.

* Any type that supports `*` operator: `int`, `double`, `float`, `complex`, etc.

❌ **Disallowed Inputs**:

* Types without `*` operator: `std::string`, `std::vector`, custom classes (unless overloaded).

## 🧠 Concept’s Job

Concept says to the compiler:

> “Only compile this function if the type supports `*` — otherwise give a clean error.”

This avoids messy errors like:

```
error: no match for ‘operator*’ (operand types are ‘std::string’ and ‘std::string’)
```
