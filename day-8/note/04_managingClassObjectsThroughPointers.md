## üëâ **Managing Class Objects Through Pointers**

"Managing class objects through pointers" means:

> You create a pointer that stores the **memory address** of an object, and then use that pointer to **access** or **modify** the object.

---

## ü§î Why Use Pointers to Objects?

| Reason            | Benefit                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîÅ Dynamic memory | Create objects at runtime using `new`                   |
| ‚õì Polymorphism    | Use base-class pointers to access derived classes (OOP) |
| ‚úÇ Efficiency      | Avoid copying large objects                             |
| üì¶ Flexibility    | Share the same object across functions/files            |

---

## ‚úÖ Basic Example: Pointer to an Object

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Car {
public:
    void start() {
        std::cout << "Car started!\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;              // normal object
    Car* carPtr = &myCar;   // pointer to object

    carPtr->start();        // use arrow (->) to access member through pointer
    (*carPtr).start();      // alternative using dereference

    return 0;
}
```

### üîç Explanation:

* `Car* carPtr = &myCar;` ‚Üí pointer to the object
* `carPtr->start();` ‚Üí calls the `start()` method of the object via pointer
* `(*carPtr).start();` ‚Üí same as above, using dereference + dot

---

## üîß Creating Object with `new`

```cpp
Car* dynamicCar = new Car();  // dynamically allocate object
dynamicCar->start();          // use it

delete dynamicCar;            // clean up memory!
```

* `new Car()` ‚Üí allocates memory on the heap
* `delete` ‚Üí releases memory (‚ö† important to avoid memory leaks)

---

## üß† Memory Visualization

```
Stack:                  Heap:
-------                ---------------
| myCar | ------------> | Car object |
-------                ---------------
           ^
           |
      carPtr
```

## üß™ Example: Pointer to Your Cylinder Class

```cpp
#include "cylinder.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Cylinder* cPtr = new Cylinder(3.0, 5.0);  // Create dynamically

    std::cout << "Volume: " << cPtr->volume() << std::endl;

    cPtr->set_height(10.0);
    std::cout << "Updated Volume: " << cPtr->volume() << std::endl;

    delete cPtr;  // Clean up
    return 0;
}
```

## üìå Accessing Members

| You write         | Means                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `obj.volume()`    | Call member on normal object     |
| `ptr->volume()`   | Call member on pointer to object |
| `(*ptr).volume()` | Also valid (but ugly)            |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept              | Explanation                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Class* ptr = &obj;` | Pointer to object                    |
| `ptr->member()`      | Access object‚Äôs member using pointer |
| `new Class()`        | Dynamically allocate object          |
| `delete ptr;`        | Free memory if using `new`           |
| `(*ptr).member()`    | Same as `ptr->member()`              |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: Prefer Smart Pointers in Modern C++

Instead of manually calling `new` and `delete`, modern C++ prefers:

```cpp
#include <memory>
auto smartPtr = std::make_unique<Cylinder>(3.0, 5.0);
smartPtr->volume();
```

‚úÖ No need to call `delete`
‚úÖ Automatic memory management

## üîç What You're Thinking:

You're saying:

> ‚ÄúA **normal object** is like a variable, and we can store its **address in a pointer**, and then use that pointer (via dereference or arrow `->`) to call that object's functions.‚Äù

And the answer is:

> ‚úÖ **Exactly right!**

---

### Let's Compare with a Regular Variable

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* p = &x;

std::cout << *p << std::endl; // prints 5
```

So:

* `x` is a **normal variable**
* `p` is a **pointer** to `x`
* `*p` accesses the **value of `x`**

---

### Now the Same Idea with a Class Object

```cpp
Car myCar;        // Normal object (like `int x`)
Car* carPtr = &myCar;  // Pointer to that object (like `int* p = &x`)
carPtr->start();       // Access member function via pointer
```

So:

* `myCar` is a **normal object** (like `x`)
* `carPtr` is a **pointer to that object** (like `p`)
* `carPtr->start()` calls the function `start()` using that pointer

You can also do:

```cpp
(*carPtr).start(); // same as carPtr->start()
```

---

## üì¶ Diagram for Visual Thinking

```
+----------------+
|   myCar object |
|----------------|
| start()        |
| drive()        |
+----------------+
        ^
        |
    carPtr
```

So `carPtr` stores the **address of `myCar`**, and `carPtr->start()` tells it:

> ‚ÄúFollow that address and call the `start()` function of the object there.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ So in Simple Terms:

| Concept                 | Equivalent To                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `int x = 10;`           | Variable                                  |
| `Car myCar;`            | Object (just like a variable, but custom) |
| `int* p = &x;`          | Pointer to variable                       |
| `Car* carPtr = &myCar;` | Pointer to object                         |
| `*p`                    | Access value of `x`                       |
| `carPtr->function()`    | Access method of `myCar`                  |
| `(*carPtr).function()`  | Same as above, longer way                 |

You're asking:

> ‚ÄúWhat is the **new** thing when we use `new` with a pointer to an object?‚Äù

Let's answer it in a **crystal-clear**, visual way.

---

## ‚úÖ What Is `new` Doing With a Pointer to Object?

When you write:

```cpp
Car* carPtr = new Car();
```

This line means:

> ‚ÄúDynamically create a `Car` object on the heap, and return a pointer to it, which I will store in `carPtr`.‚Äù

---

## üîç Key Differences from Normal Object

| Feature             | Normal Object (`Car myCar;`) | Pointer with `new` (`Car* ptr = new Car();`) |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory location** | Stack                        | Heap (dynamic memory)                        |
| **Lifetime**        | Automatically managed        | Manually managed (you must delete it)        |
| **Access**          | Dot: `myCar.start()`         | Arrow: `ptr->start()`                        |
| **Destruction**     | Happens automatically        | You must call `delete ptr;`                  |
| **Size known at**   | Compile-time                 | Runtime                                      |

---

## üß± Example

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    void start() {
        std::cout << "Starting car\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Car* carPtr = new Car();     // üîπ Creates object on heap
    carPtr->start();             // üîπ Access using pointer

    delete carPtr;               // üî• Free memory manually
    return 0;
}
```

---

## üí• What If You Forget `delete`?

You get a **memory leak**.

The object stays in memory until the program ends ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre no longer using it.

So always:

```cpp
delete carPtr;
```

---

## üîÅ Summary: What‚Äôs New When You Use `new`?

| Feature             | What It Means                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `new Class()`       | Creates object on heap and returns pointer   |
| `delete pointer;`   | Destroys the object and frees memory         |
| `->`                | Used to access members via pointer           |
| Manual lifetime     | You control when the object is destroyed     |
| Dynamic flexibility | Can create objects at runtime, conditionally |

---

## üìå Real Use Case of `new` With Object Pointers

Useful when:

* You don‚Äôt know how many objects you need at compile time
* You want the object to live **outside the current function's scope**
* You're building **linked lists**, **trees**, or **objects inside classes**
* You're using **polymorphism** and **inheritance**

---

## üîÑ Without `new` vs With `new`

```cpp
Car myCar;         // Stack ‚Äî automatic memory
Car* carPtr = new Car();  // Heap ‚Äî manual memory
```

```cpp
myCar.start();        // normal
carPtr->start();      // pointer
(*carPtr).start();    // also works
```



---
---
---


### üîπ Case 1: Pointer to an existing stack object

```cpp
Car car;                // Object created on the stack
Car* carPtr = &car;     // Pointer to that stack object
carPtr->start();        // Calls start() on the same stack object
```

* `car` lives on the **stack**.
* `carPtr` just **points** to that existing object (no new memory allocated).
* The object will be **destroyed automatically** when it goes out of scope (no `delete` needed).
* Safe, efficient, but lifetime is tied to scope.

---

### üîπ Case 2: Pointer to a new heap object

```cpp
Car* carPtr = new Car();  // Object created on the heap
carPtr->start();          
delete carPtr;            // You must free manually!
```

* A brand-new `Car` is created on the **heap**.
* `carPtr` points to this heap-allocated object.
* The object will **not be destroyed automatically** when it goes out of scope.
* You must explicitly call `delete carPtr;` or you‚Äôll cause a **memory leak**.
* Lifetime is fully under your control.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Differences Between the Two

| Aspect                | `Car car; Car* carPtr = &car;` | `Car* carPtr = new Car();`                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory                | Stack                          | Heap                                                             |
| Who manages lifetime? | Compiler (automatic)           | Programmer (manual `delete`)                                     |
| Pointer points to     | Existing object                | Newly allocated object                                           |
| Cleanup               | Automatic at scope end         | Must `delete` explicitly                                         |
| Use cases             | Temporary/local objects, RAII  | Objects that need to outlive scope, dynamic arrays, polymorphism |

---

### ‚ö° Example

```cpp
void foo() {
    Car car;               // stack object
    Car* carPtr1 = &car;   // pointer to stack object
    carPtr1->start();      // valid
} // car destroyed automatically, carPtr1 becomes dangling

void bar() {
    Car* carPtr2 = new Car();  // heap object
    carPtr2->start();
    delete carPtr2;            // must clean up
} // memory freed only if delete is called
```

---

üëâ So the **difference is not in the pointer syntax** (`carPtr->start()` works in both), but in **who owns the memory** and **how long the object lives**.


---
---
---

Yes ‚Äî **from the pointer‚Äôs point of view**, both work the same:

```cpp
carPtr->start();
```

will call the `start()` function in **both cases**.
So in terms of **using the object through the pointer**, they behave the same.

---

But the **big difference** is in **lifetime and ownership**:

### 1. Pointer to stack object

```cpp
Car car;                // stack object
Car* carPtr = &car;     // pointer to it
carPtr->start();
```

* The object `car` is destroyed automatically when the scope ends.
* `carPtr` becomes **dangling** after the scope ends (pointing to invalid memory).
* You **must not delete** `carPtr` (since you didn‚Äôt use `new`).

---

### 2. Pointer to heap object

```cpp
Car* carPtr = new Car(); 
carPtr->start();
delete carPtr;
```

* Object lives on the **heap** until you manually `delete` it.
* It **survives after the scope** if you pass the pointer around.
* If you forget to `delete`, it causes a **memory leak**.

---

### ‚úÖ Same interface, different responsibilities

* Both can call methods with `->`.
* Both ‚Äúwork‚Äù while valid.
* But **stack objects clean up automatically**, while **heap objects require manual cleanup**.

---

‚ö° Analogy:

* **Stack object** = hotel room booked for 1 night. Checkout happens automatically next morning.
* **Heap object** = rented apartment. You must explicitly move out and return the keys (delete).
