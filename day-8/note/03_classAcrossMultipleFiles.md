## ✅ What Does "Class Across Multiple Files" Mean?

It means you break up your class definition into **two parts**:

| File Type      | Contains What?                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `.h` or `.hpp` | Header file → Class **declaration/definition**   |
| `.cpp`         | Source file → Class **function implementations** |
| `main.cpp`     | Main program that **uses** the class             |

This is done to:

* Keep code organized
* Avoid clutter
* Separate **interface** from **implementation**

---

## 🔨 Example: Splitting a `Car` Class

We'll split a simple `Car` class into 3 files:

```
Car.h        ← class definition
Car.cpp      ← member function implementations
main.cpp     ← uses the Car class
```

---

### 📁 File 1: `Car.h` (Header File)

```cpp
// Car.h
#pragma once  // or use include guards
#include <string>

class Car {
public:
    Car(const std::string& brand, int year);
    void start();
    void displayInfo();

private:
    std::string brand;
    int year;
};
```

---

### 📁 File 2: `Car.cpp` (Source File)

```cpp
// Car.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Car.h"

Car::Car(const std::string& brand, int year) {
    this->brand = brand;
    this->year = year;
}

void Car::start() {
    std::cout << brand << " is starting.\n";
}

void Car::displayInfo() {
    std::cout << "Car: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << "\n";
}
```

---

### 📁 File 3: `main.cpp`

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Car.h"

int main() {
    Car myCar("Toyota", 2020);
    myCar.start();
    myCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

1. `main.cpp` includes `Car.h`
2. `Car.h` says: "This is what the class looks like"
3. `Car.cpp` says: "This is what the class **does**"
4. You **compile all files together** to make the final program

---

## 🛠️ How to Compile Multiple Files

Using g++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp Car.cpp -o myProgram
```

Or in VS Code, just add all files to your task config.

## 🤔 Why Split Classes Like This?

| Reason       | Benefit                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization | Easier to manage big projects                                 |
| Reusability  | You can reuse the header file in other projects               |
| Speed        | Recompiling only the `.cpp` file if you change implementation |
| Separation   | Interface (`.h`) vs implementation (`.cpp`) makes it cleaner  |

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Think of `Car.h` as a **menu card** in a restaurant.
Think of `Car.cpp` as the **kitchen** where the real work is done.

You show the customer (other programmers) only the menu (`Car.h`), not the kitchen mess (`Car.cpp`).

## ✅ Summary

| File       | Purpose                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Car.h`    | Declares what the class contains (blueprint)      |
| `Car.cpp`  | Defines how the functions behave (implementation) |
| `main.cpp` | Uses the class                                    |

## ✅ The Code You Gave

```cpp
#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

const double PI{3.1415926535897932384626433832795};

#endif
```

---

## 🔍 What Does This Mean?

This is called a **header guard** or **include guard**.

Its job is to **prevent the same file from being included more than once** during compilation.

---

## 🔄 What Problem Is It Solving?

Imagine this situation:

* You include `constants.h` in multiple files
* All those files include **each other** (directly or indirectly)
* The compiler might try to include `constants.h` **multiple times**
* This causes **duplicate definition errors**

> 💥 Error: `PI` redefined

---

## ✅ What the Guard Does

Let’s understand each line:

### 🔹 `#ifndef CONSTANTS_H`

> If NOT defined `CONSTANTS_H`
> (i.e., has this macro not been defined yet?)

### 🔹 `#define CONSTANTS_H`

> Okay, now define it.
> So next time someone includes this file, this block is **skipped**.

### 🔹 `const double PI{...};`

> Your actual code.

### 🔹 `#endif`

> End of the guard block.

---

## 🔁 So what happens at compile time?

1. First time `constants.h` is included:

   * `CONSTANTS_H` is not defined → so code runs
   * `PI` is defined
   * `CONSTANTS_H` is now marked as defined

2. Second time:

   * `#ifndef CONSTANTS_H` → already defined → skip whole file ✅

---

## ✅ Visual Flow

```
Has CONSTANTS_H been defined?
     |
     |-- No --> Define CONSTANTS_H → define PI → done
     |
     |-- Yes → Skip everything → avoid error
```

---

## 🧠 Alternative: Use `#pragma once`

A modern and simpler way (supported by most compilers):

```cpp
#pragma once

const double PI{3.1415926535897932384626433832795};
```

✔ This does the same thing, but is **shorter** and **cleaner**

❌ However, it's **not part of the official C++ standard** (but widely supported).

---

## ✅ Summary

| Line                   | Meaning                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `#ifndef CONSTANTS_H`  | "If this header hasn’t been included yet..." |
| `#define CONSTANTS_H`  | "...mark it as included now"                 |
| `const double PI{...}` | Actual declaration                           |
| `#endif`               | End of header guard                          |

```cpp
double Cylinder::volume() {
```

This is known as the **scope resolution operator** (`::`), and I'll explain it **simply and visually**.

---

## ✅ Why Do We Use `Cylinder::` in `cylinder.cpp`?

Because you're writing the **member function implementation** of the `Cylinder` class **outside the class definition**, and you need to tell the compiler:

> "This function belongs to the `Cylinder` class."

---

### 🔍 What does `Cylinder::` mean?

`Cylinder::volume()` means:

> “This is the `volume` function that belongs to the class `Cylinder`.”

It's like saying:

> "I’m defining the function `volume()` **inside the namespace** of class `Cylinder`."

---

### ✅ Let’s Revisit Your `Cylinder.h`

```cpp
class Cylinder {
public:
    double volume();  // only the declaration
};
```

At this point, the compiler knows:

> “Okay, `volume()` exists, but I don’t yet know **what it does**.”

---

### ✅ Then You Go to `Cylinder.cpp`

```cpp
double Cylinder::volume() {
    return PI * base_radius * base_radius * height;
}
```

Now you’re saying:

> “Here is the actual **definition** of the `volume()` function, and it belongs to `Cylinder`.”

---

## 🎯 Analogy: Addressing a Function

Think of a school:

* Many classes: `Math`, `Science`, `Cylinder`
* Each class has a student named `volume()`

If you just say:

```cpp
volume()
```

The compiler asks:

> “Which class are you talking about?”

You clarify:

```cpp
Cylinder::volume()
```

Now the compiler knows:

> “Ah, you're talking about the `volume()` inside the `Cylinder` class.”

---

## 🔧 Why Not Define the Function Inside the Class?

You *can* do this if you want:

```cpp
class Cylinder {
public:
    double volume() {
        return PI * base_radius * base_radius * height;
    }
};
```

✅ This works too!

But in real-world large projects, you keep **function bodies in `.cpp` files** to:

* Make header files cleaner
* Improve readability
* Avoid repeating code during inclusion
* Reduce compile-time dependencies

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Cylinder::volume()`    | Says: This function belongs to class `Cylinder`                          |
| `::` (scope resolution) | Used to specify that a function or variable is part of a class/namespace |
| Defined in `.cpp`       | Keeps header clean, and separates interface from implementation          |
