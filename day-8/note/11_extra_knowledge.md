Ah, got it üëç You‚Äôre asking **‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù** about the line:

```cpp
auto b = std::make_unique<Bird>("Parrot", "Green", 3);
```

Let‚Äôs break it down slowly:

---

### 1. `std::unique_ptr`

* A **smart pointer** type in C++.
* It ‚Äúowns‚Äù a heap object (created with `new`) and **automatically deletes it** when the smart pointer goes out of scope.
* That means you don‚Äôt need to write `delete` manually.

So instead of:

```cpp
Bird* b = new Bird("Parrot", "Green", 3);
// ... use b
delete b;   // ‚ùå must remember or you‚Äôll leak memory
```

We use:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<Bird> b = std::make_unique<Bird>("Parrot", "Green", 3);
// ‚úÖ automatically calls delete when `b` goes out of scope
```

---

### 2. `std::make_unique<Bird>(...)`

* A **factory function** that creates a `Bird` on the heap and wraps it inside a `std::unique_ptr`.
* Safer than calling `new` directly, because:

  * No risk of forgetting `delete`.
  * Prevents leaks if an exception is thrown.
  * Code is shorter and cleaner.

---

### 3. `auto`

* Lets the compiler figure out the type automatically.
* Here, `auto` means:

  ```cpp
  auto b = std::make_unique<Bird>("Parrot", "Green", 3);
  ```

  is the same as writing:

  ```cpp
  std::unique_ptr<Bird> b = std::make_unique<Bird>("Parrot", "Green", 3);
  ```

---

### 4. How it works in practice

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>   // needed for unique_ptr and make_unique

class Bird {
public:
    Bird(std::string name, std::string breed, int age)
        : name(name), breed(breed), p_age(new int(age)) {}
    
    ~Bird() {
        delete p_age;
        std::cout << "Bird destructor called for " << name << "\n";
    }

    void print_info() {
        std::cout << "Bird : [ name : " << name
                  << " breed : " << breed
                  << " age : " << *p_age << " ]\n";
    }

private:
    std::string name;
    std::string breed;
    int* p_age;
};

int main() {
    auto b = std::make_unique<Bird>("Parrot", "Green", 3);
    b->print_info();

} // ‚úÖ Destructor called automatically, no memory leak
```

---

‚úÖ So, **`std::make_unique` + `std::unique_ptr` = safe heap allocation without leaks.**
You never call `delete` yourself.

---

Do you want me to also explain **the difference between `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr`** (since both are smart pointers but behave differently)?
