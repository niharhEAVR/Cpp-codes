In your program, the sequence of execution, especially with respect to **constructor and destructor calls**, follows a clear and defined order based on:

1. The order in which objects are created in `main()`.
2. The reverse order in which they go out of scope when `main()` ends.

---

### Here's your `main()`:

```cpp
int main() {
    Dog dog1("Dogyy1", "Shepherd", 2);
    Dog dog2("Dogyy2", "Shepherd", 3);
}
```

---

### Step-by-step Execution:

#### 1. `Dog dog1("Dogyy1", "Shepherd", 2);`

* `Dog` constructor is called.
* `name = "Dogyy1"`, `breed = "Shepherd"`, `*p_age = 2` (using `new int`).
* Prints:

  ```
  Dog constructor called for Dogyy1
  ```

#### 2. `Dog dog2("Dogyy2", "Shepherd", 3);`

* Another `Dog` constructor is called.
* `name = "Dogyy2"`, `breed = "Shepherd"`, `*p_age = 3`.
* Prints:

  ```
  Dog constructor called for Dogyy2
  ```

---

### Now the function `main()` ends ‚Äî the **destructors are called in reverse order** of construction:

#### 3. `dog2` goes out of scope first:

* `~Dog()` is called for `dog2`.
* `delete p_age` is executed, memory released.
* Prints:

  ```
  Dog destructor called for : Dogyy2
  ```

#### 4. `dog1` goes out of scope next:

* `~Dog()` is called for `dog1`.
* `delete p_age` is executed, memory released.
* Prints:

  ```
  Dog destructor called for : Dogyy1
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Output (Console):

```
Dog constructor called for Dogyy1
Dog constructor called for Dogyy2
Dog destructor called for : Dogyy2
Dog destructor called for : Dogyy1
```

Let‚Äôs **break down *why* constructors and destructors behave in this order**, step by step.

---

## üîß 1. **Why constructors are called in order of declaration?**

In your `main()`:

```cpp
Dog dog1("Dogyy1", "Shepherd", 2);
Dog dog2("Dogyy2", "Shepherd", 3);
```

These are **local (stack) variables**, and C++ **guarantees** that local variables are **constructed in the order they are declared** ‚Äî top to bottom.

‚û°Ô∏è So first `dog1` is created, then `dog2`.

---

## üî• 2. **Why destructors are called in reverse order?**

Once `main()` ends, the objects `dog2` and `dog1` go out of scope. But **C++ destroys local (stack) objects in reverse order of their construction**.

This is because of **dependence and safety**.

### üì¶ Analogy: Stack of Plates

Imagine this like stacking plates:

```
Stack:
Top ‚Üí dog2 (last in)
       dog1 (first in)
```

Now when the function ends, the stack unwinds:

```
Destruction (popping plates):
1st: dog2
2nd: dog1
```

---

## ‚úÖ Why is this important?

Because **later objects might depend on earlier ones**, and destroying them in the reverse order ensures things are destroyed cleanly and safely.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Example Why Reverse Destruction is Important:

Imagine this:

```cpp
class A {
    B b;  // uses another object B
};
```

If `B` was destroyed **before** `A`, and `A` tries to access `B` in its destructor, you'll get **undefined behavior**. So C++ destroys them in the safe reverse order.

---

## üí° Summary

| Event        | Order                                   | Why?                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Constructors | Top to bottom (order of declaration)    | Objects are created as you write them.         |
| Destructors  | Bottom to top (reverse of construction) | Ensures safe destruction and resource cleanup. |
