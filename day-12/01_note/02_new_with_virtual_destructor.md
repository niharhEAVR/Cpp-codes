That’s a very sharp observation 👌 — let me break it down carefully because this is one of the **most confusing parts of C++ polymorphism**.

---

## 🔹 1. Normal case (no inheritance)

If you have a class **without inheritance**, you don’t need a `virtual` destructor.
Example:

```cpp
class Dog {
public:
    ~Dog() {
        cout << "Dog destroyed\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog* d = new Dog();
    delete d;   // ✅ calls Dog::~Dog()
}
```

Here it works fine because the pointer type (`Dog*`) and the actual object type (`Dog`) match.

---

## 🔹 2. With inheritance but no `virtual` destructor

Now suppose we have a base class `Animal` and derived class `Dog`:

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    ~Animal() { cout << "Animal destroyed\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    ~Dog() { cout << "Dog destroyed\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    delete a;   // ❌ Problem!
}
```

**What happens?**

* Since `Animal`’s destructor is **not virtual**, deleting through `Animal*` will only call `Animal::~Animal()`.
* `Dog::~Dog()` will **NOT** run.

👉 This means that if `Dog` has resources (heap memory, file handles, sockets), they will leak.

---

## 🔹 3. With inheritance + `virtual` destructor ✅

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual ~Animal() { cout << "Animal destroyed\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    ~Dog() { cout << "Dog destroyed\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    delete a;   // ✅ calls Dog::~Dog(), then Animal::~Animal()
}
```

Now the destructor is **virtual**, so C++ looks at the **actual object type (`Dog`) at runtime**.

* First calls `Dog::~Dog()`
* Then calls `Animal::~Animal()`

This ensures complete cleanup.

---

## 🔹 4. Why needed “outside the class” (even if no heap inside class)?

You’re right that **if a class has no heap variables**, a destructor doesn’t need to do anything special.
But the **problem is at the hierarchy level, not inside the class itself**.

The compiler must know whether to destroy the object **based on its static type (pointer type)** or its **dynamic type (actual object)**.

* Without `virtual` → destruction uses **static type** (pointer type).
* With `virtual` → destruction uses **dynamic type** (real object).

So even if a derived class doesn’t allocate heap inside, making the base destructor `virtual` ensures that if someone later extends the class **and adds heap variables**, cleanup still works correctly.

---

## 🔹 5. Real-world analogy

Imagine you hire a **base-class janitor** (`Animal::~Animal`) to clean a house, but the house is actually a **fancy dog-house with extra rooms** (`Dog::~Dog`).

* If you don’t tell the janitor to “check the actual type of house” (virtual destructor), they’ll only clean the basic rooms, leaving the dog’s extra rooms dirty.
* Virtual destructor tells them: **“Look at the real house type and call that cleanup too.”**

---

✅ **In short**:

* **If you use `new` + `delete` with base class pointers, the base destructor must be virtual.**
* This ensures correct cleanup of derived class resources.
* Without `virtual`, only the base destructor runs → risk of leaks.
