### 🔹 First, what is **private inheritance**?

In C++ inheritance, the **access specifier** (`public`, `protected`, `private`) decides how the base class’s members are treated inside the derived class.

* **Private inheritance** means:

  * `public` and `protected` members of the base class become `private` in the derived class.
  * `private` members of the base class are never inherited directly.
  * Outside code cannot treat the derived object as a base object.

Example:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void show() { std::cout << "Base::show\n"; }
};

class Derived : private Base {  // private inheritance
public:
    void useShow() {
        show(); // OK, because inside Derived it can access Base::show()
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    // d.show(); ❌ Error: show() is private in Derived
    d.useShow(); // ✅ Works
}
```

### 🔹 What does **“closing in”** mean here?

When people say **“private inheritance closes in on the base class”**, they mean:

1. **The base class’s interface is hidden from the outside world.**

   * With public inheritance, a `Derived` is-a `Base`.
   * With private inheritance, a `Derived` has-a `Base` implementation, but it’s not exposed.

2. **The relationship is implementation-only, not an is-a relationship.**

   * Think of it as: “Derived uses Base privately to implement its features.”
   * It’s like composition but done via inheritance.

3. **It prevents external access.**

   * Clients of `Derived` cannot access `Base`’s public members directly.
   * This “closes” the access boundary — only `Derived` itself can use them.

✅ In short:
**“Closing in on private inheritance” means the base class functionality is locked inside the derived class. Outside code cannot use the base’s public interface through the derived object.**
