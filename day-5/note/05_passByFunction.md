# 🔷 1. Pass by Value (Default)

### ✅ What it means:

> A **copy** of the variable is passed to the function.
> The original variable is **not changed**.

---

### 🔹 Syntax:

```cpp
void update(int x);  // function declaration

void update(int x) {
    x = 100;  // changes only the local copy
}
```

---

### 🔹 Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void changeValue(int x) {
    x = 50;
    cout << "Inside function: x = " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    changeValue(a);
    cout << "Outside function: a = " << a << endl;  // still 10
}
```

🟢 Output:

```
Inside function: x = 50
Outside function: a = 10
```

✅ Original `a` was **unchanged**.

---

# 🔷 2. Pass by Pointer

### ✅ What it means:

> A **memory address** of the variable is passed.
> The function can **change the original value**.

---

### 🔹 Syntax:

```cpp
void update(int* x);

void update(int* x) {
    *x = 100;  // change value at the address
}
```

---

### 🔹 Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void changeValue(int* x) {
    *x = 50;  // modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    changeValue(&a);  // pass address of a
    cout << "a = " << a << endl;  // now 50
}
```

🟢 Output:

```
a = 50
```

✅ You changed the original variable using pointer dereferencing.

---

# 🔷 3. Pass by Reference (Modern & Safe)

### ✅ What it means:

> You pass the **actual variable**, not a copy or pointer.
> Any changes directly affect the original.

---

### 🔹 Syntax:

```cpp
void update(int& x);  // & means reference

void update(int& x) {
    x = 100;
}
```

---

### 🔹 Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void changeValue(int& x) {
    x = 50;  // modifies the original variable
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    changeValue(a);  // no need to pass address
    cout << "a = " << a << endl;  // now 50
}
```

🟢 Output:

```
a = 50
```

✅ This is the **simplest and safest way** to allow a function to modify the original variable.

## 🔹 When to Use Which?

| Use Case                            | Recommended Method   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| You just need to read the value     | Pass by Value        |
| You want to change the value        | Pass by Reference    |
| You work with arrays/dynamic memory | Pass by Pointer      |
| You return multiple outputs         | Reference or Pointer |

## ✅ Real-World Example: Swapping Values

### 🔸 By Value (❌ doesn't work):

```cpp
void swap(int a, int b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;
swap(x, y);  // ❌ won't swap
```

---

### 🔸 By Reference (✅ correct):

```cpp
void swap(int& a, int& b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

---

## ✅ Bonus: Mixing Value and Reference

```cpp
void update(int val, int& ref) {
    val = 100;
    ref = 100;
}
```

Call with:

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 20;
update(a, b);
// a stays 10 (value), b becomes 100 (reference)
```

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept       | How it works                | Can modify original? | Needs `*` or `&`? |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Value**     | Makes a copy                | ❌ No                 | ❌                 |
| **Pointer**   | Passes memory address       | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes             |
| **Reference** | Alias for original variable | ✅ Yes                | ❌                 |

### 🧠 What Does “Pass by Reference” Mean?

When you **pass a variable by reference**, you are **not sending a copy**.
You're sending the **original variable itself**, just with a different name (alias) inside the function.

---

## ✅ Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void modify(int& x) {
    x = x + 5;
    cout << "Inside function: x = " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    modify(a);
    cout << "Outside function: a = " << a << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🖼️ Step-by-Step Visualization

Let’s draw what happens in memory:

---

### 🔸 **Before Calling `modify(a);`**

```
main():
┌──────┐
│  a   │ → 10
└──────┘
```

You have an integer variable `a = 10`.

---

### 🔸 **Call: `modify(a);`**

Function signature is:

```cpp
void modify(int& x)
```

This means:

* `x` is just another **name (alias)** for `a`.
* Both `x` and `a` refer to the **same memory location**.

```
main():            modify():
┌──────┐           ┌──────┐
│  a   │ ←───────→ │  x   │   (x is alias for a)
└──────┘           └──────┘
    10                 (same address)
```

Then, the function does:

```cpp
x = x + 5;  // modifies a directly!
```

Now the memory becomes:

```
main():            modify():
┌──────┐           ┌──────┐
│  a   │ ←───────→ │  x   │
└──────┘           └──────┘
    15
```

---

### 🔸 **After Function Ends**

```cpp
cout << "a = " << a;
```

✅ `a` is now `15`, because `x` modified the same variable.

---

## ✅ Summary of What’s Happening

| Action             | Result                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `x` is a reference | No new memory created             |
| Changes in `x`     | Directly affect `a`               |
| Function ends      | `x` dies, but `a` keeps new value |

---

## ❗ Compare with Pass by Value

If you used:

```cpp
void modify(int x)  // pass by value
```

Then:

* A **copy** of `a` would be made
* `x` and `a` would point to **different memory**
* Changes to `x` would not affect `a`

🧊 Visual:

```
main():      modify():
┌──────┐     ┌──────┐
│  a   │     │  x   │
└──────┘     └──────┘
    10           10  → change here won't affect a
```

## 🧠 Analogy: Water Bottle

* **Pass by Value** = You give your **friend a photocopy** of your water bottle → they scratch the copy → your bottle is fine.
* **Pass by Reference** = You give your **actual water bottle** to your friend → they drink from it → it affects your bottle.
