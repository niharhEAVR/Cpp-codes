## 🔹 Statement:

> **"Don’t call virtual polymorphic functions from constructors or destructors"**

This means: inside a **constructor** or **destructor**, calling a `virtual` function **will not behave polymorphically**. Instead, it will call the version of the function for the **current class being constructed or destroyed** — not the derived class’s version.

---

### Why does this happen?

When a constructor or destructor runs, the **object’s type is not yet fully constructed or is already partially destroyed**.

* **During construction:** The derived part of the object isn’t ready yet → only the base part exists.
* **During destruction:** The derived part is already destroyed → only the base part remains.

C++ **statically binds** virtual calls inside constructors/destructors to the type of the current constructor/destructor.

---

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    Base() {
        cout << "Base constructor called" << endl;
        show(); // ❗ virtual call inside constructor
    }

    virtual ~Base() {
        cout << "Base destructor called" << endl;
        show(); // ❗ virtual call inside destructor
    }

    virtual void show() {
        cout << "Base::show()" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() {
        cout << "Derived constructor called" << endl;
        show();
    }

    ~Derived() {
        cout << "Derived destructor called" << endl;
        show();
    }

    void show() override {
        cout << "Derived::show()" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;
}
```

---

### Expected Output:

```
Base constructor called
Base::show()
Derived constructor called
Derived::show()
Derived destructor called
Derived::show()
Base destructor called
Base::show()
```

---

### Key Observations:

1. **Inside Base constructor** → even though `show()` is virtual, it calls **`Base::show()`**, not `Derived::show()`.
2. **Inside Base destructor** → it also calls `Base::show()`, not `Derived::show()`.

Why?
Because during construction, the derived part doesn’t exist yet, and during destruction, the derived part is already gone. The object behaves like a **Base object** inside those phases.

---

### 🔹 Why it’s a bad idea

Calling virtual functions in constructors/destructors breaks polymorphism expectations.
It can cause:

* Unexpected behavior
* Bugs that are hard to track
* Partial object state use (since derived members might not yet be initialized)

---

### 🔹 Rule of Thumb:

* **Never call virtual functions inside constructors or destructors**.
* If you need polymorphic behavior during construction/destruction → consider **Factory functions** or **post-construction initialization** instead.

## 1️⃣ The core problem

When you call a virtual function in C++ normally, the call goes through the **virtual table (vtable)** and resolves to the **most-derived version** of the function at runtime.
But **constructors** and **destructors** are special cases — they **disable polymorphic dispatch** for the part of the object that isn’t fully constructed or is already destroyed.

That means:

> In a constructor or destructor, a virtual call acts like a **non-virtual call** — it resolves to the function in the **current class**, not the derived class.

---

## 2️⃣ Why it happens — object state during construction/destruction

### Construction process:

```
When creating Derived object:
1. Base constructor runs → object is treated as a Base object
2. Derived constructor runs → object is treated as a Derived object
```

Inside the **Base constructor**, the object is **not yet a Derived object** because Derived part hasn’t been initialized.
So virtual dispatch is “locked” to Base.

---

### Destruction process:

```
When deleting Derived object:
1. Derived destructor runs → object is still a Derived object
2. Base destructor runs → object is now a Base object
```

Inside the **Base destructor**, the Derived part has already been destroyed → the object is treated as a Base object.

---

## 3️⃣ Example

Let’s revisit your example in simpler terms:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base() { show(); }
    virtual ~Base() { show(); }
    virtual void show() { std::cout << "Base show\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() { show(); }
    ~Derived() { show(); }
    void show() override { std::cout << "Derived show\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;
}
```

### What happens step-by-step:

#### **Construction**

1. `Base()` constructor runs first
   → virtual call to `show()` resolves to **Base::show()**, not Derived::show().
   Reason: Derived part is not constructed yet.

2. `Derived()` constructor runs
   → virtual call to `show()` resolves to **Derived::show()**.

#### **Destruction**

1. `Derived()` destructor runs first
   → virtual call to `show()` resolves to **Derived::show()**.

2. `Base()` destructor runs
   → virtual call to `show()` resolves to **Base::show()**, not Derived::show().
   Reason: Derived part is already destroyed.

---

### Output:

```
Base show
Derived show
Derived show
Base show
```

---

## 4️⃣ Why this is a problem

The “broken” polymorphism means:

* You **cannot rely on a virtual call** in a constructor/destructor to behave polymorphically.
* This can cause **bugs** if the function depends on derived-class state or members that haven’t been initialized yet (in constructors) or already destroyed (in destructors).

---

### Example of real danger:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base() { init(); }
    virtual void init() { std::cout << "Base init\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
    int* data;
public:
    Derived() : data(new int(42)) {}
    ~Derived() { delete data; }
    void init() override { std::cout << *data << "\n"; }
};
```

Here → calling `init()` in `Base()` constructor will call `Base::init()` safely. But if we thought it would call `Derived::init()` → we’d try accessing `data` before it’s initialized → **undefined behavior**.

---

## ✅ The Rule

**Never call virtual functions from constructors or destructors** because:

1. The object’s type is not “fully formed” during construction.
2. The derived part may already be destroyed during destruction.
3. It can easily cause undefined behavior or subtle bugs.
